Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! This repository contains my solutions and notes for the Advent of Code challenges.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December. It consists of 25 daily coding puzzles or challenges, starting from December 1st until December 25th. These challenges are designed to be fun, engaging, and a great way to improve your problem-solving skills while having a festive coding experience.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- `tasks/`: Each day's challenge is in its own folder, labeled `dayXX` (replace `XX` with the day number).
    - `Task(X).kt`: Solution and code for part 1 of the challenge.
    - `Task(X+1).kt`: Solution and code for part 2 of the challenge.
    - `task_input.txt`: Input provided for the challenge.
    - `task_input_test.txt`: Short testing input provided for the challenge.
- `Main.kt`: Main class containing execution code for the tasks and benchmark for measuring the speed of the algorithm
